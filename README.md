# netflix-bypass
Bypassing the netflix household restriction

## Description
Just a simple script to block the request to check the household restriction on netflix.
(Work only for chromium-based browsers for now)

The only permission required is "tabs" to be able to detect if the user is on netflix and to inject the script.

## Installation

### Chromium-based browsers
1. Edge : Go to `edge://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", click "Load unpacked" and select the `chromium` folder in the project.

2. Chrome : Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", click "Load unpacked" and select the `chromium` folder in the project.

If someone is on firefox, contact me on discord (`_biby_`) to make it work for firefox too.
